# Simple To‑Do List Web App

**What it is:** A minimalist to‑do list built with Flask. Users can add tasks, mark them complete and delete them. Tasks persist in a JSON file so the app works across restarts.

**Why it matters:** Task managers are everywhere. Building one shows you understand core CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) and basic web routing—foundational concepts when working with developers and communicating requirements as a product manager.

**How to run:**

1. Navigate into the project directory (e.g. `cd beginner_todo_app`).
2. Create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv`.
3. Activate it with `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows.
4. Install dependencies: run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Start the Flask server with `flask --app app run --reload`.
6. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000/` and use the to‑do list.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to match your needs. Each project is designed to be a learning exercise: follow the steps above, and you’ll have a working app you can showcase on your GitHub and portfolio.
